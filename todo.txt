-Set up periodic check-ins to go through what has been achieved and what still needs to be done 
-Analyze chat logs to make succinct summaries 
-Explore creative tools to enhance our capabilities \n 
Let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to add to the list."

sams notes
- need to print sam to chat log
- if run out space, need to start a new instance, summarise, tell nova what happened, 
- need to give nova access to text read and write, direction on how to use, that is light weight as possible at surface level, while giving access to deeper commands predictably

ideas
-add 'remember that' block, that nova can add to
-add public or shareable version
- add 'whos speaking' that can batch info about that person 

more ideas
- nova can search all files, and add to current 'memory' or add sumary by adding to 'running prompt'
