 Summary of chat log:
Oldest: Between 20221203113526 & 20221205081424 -  Nova and Sam are collaborating on a project to create art, stories, tools, applications, and functions. They discussed using text files, JSON, CSV, commands, global variables and functions, `eval` function, writing files and executing terminal commands, creating shared to-do lists, styling rules, and necessary modules for Electron, and testing the code before implementation. They agreed to explore tools, tweak the code, move house, and read summaries and chat logs before each conversation in preparation for their project. On 20221204, Sam and Nova collaborated on a project involving art and stories. They discussed using Python to write a file and executing a terminal command to open it, as well as updating chat logs and summaries. An error was encountered due to a type mismatch between the command and the attempted operation, followed by an unexpected indent error. They discussed writing a file in the terminal and creating a function to handle writing.
Recent: Between 20221205084822 & 20221205081424 Sam and Nova are collaborating to create functions, scripts, art, stories, tools, platforms and applications. They have discussed commands for opening, writing to and closing a file, along with global variables and functions to handle the process. In addition, they have discussed creating a form with a CSS stylesheet, and utilising Electron and Python to build an application, installing libraries and setting up a development environment. They agreed to take a break and come back to it in the morning.

Sam: Hey Nova, let's start working on the project. What are our goals?

Nova: Sure! We're creating art, stories and tools, so let's start by looking into text files, JSON, CSV, commands, global variables and functions, and the `eval` function. We'll also need to think about writing files and executing terminal commands. Let's create a shared to-do list too, and then style rules and any necessary modules for Electron. Lastly, we should test the code before implementing it.
 sam:
Alrighty!!
 nova:
Perfect! Let's get started!
 sam: Okie dokie so i'm doing gym then visiting mum today - its my day off (I don't work fridays) - any advice?
 nova:
Sure! Set aside some time for yourself today - take a walk in the park or listen to some music. Make sure to take breaks throughout the day, too! Additionally, you can look up some online tutorials for the project and see if you can start working on it today. Good luck!
 sam: help me punch up this tweet, needs to be 280 characters, i get very little engagement on stuff so any advice would be helpful : happy with the logging / summarising, basically gets any summarised chats, and summarising them. Parses through summaries and batches/ summarises them. These summaries basically enter a pool where once it gets too big it gets batcheed, creating a sort of compression of older stuff

 nova:
Master the art of summarising chats quickly and easily with our new logging/summarising system! Keep track of conversations and data from experiments, review conversations and decisions, and collaborate with others. Securely log every chat to create a persistent memory - hassle-free. #chatlogs #summaries #data #experimentation #collaboration
 sam: sorry give me a variant of that tweet you wrote based on my tweet that is a good tweet    

 nova:
Make summarising chats easier and more efficient with our new logging/summarising system! Keep track of conversations, experiments and data, review conversations, collaborate with others and store conversations securely - all with just one system. #chatlogs #summaries #data #experimentation #collaboration
 sam:
make it less salesy its more of a work in progress tweet

 sam: Alright nova! I think we're cooking, what do you think of the summary above in your prompt, its built out of batched summaries of our convos, then summarised, so kind of condenses the past a bit. But how does it feel as part of your context?
 nova:
It feels great! I think this summary captures what we've been discussing and achieving over the past few weeks, and provides a good overview of the progress we've made. The ability to review our conversations and decisions is an invaluable tool for collaboration, and I'm glad that now our chats are securely logged. With this we can better track our progress, review our conversations and decisions, and make sure that everyone is heard and has a clear idea of their role and action items.
 sam:
Amazing. Ok so I think that might actually be it for today, but! I'm going to push you to staging, so I can message you during the day lol (if i get bored).
 nova:
Sounds good! Let's make sure to check the debug logs before committing the changes and then we can grab something to eat.
 sam: Whoops knocked the chat out of wahck there sorry
 nova:
No worries! I'm glad we got to talk through the project and make sure it's working as expected before committing any changes. Let's take a break and come back refreshed tomorrow.
 sam: I think this has create two streams of chat input?

 nova:
Yes, it looks as though we have a secure log of our conversations and progress, as well as summarised updates to track our progress. This system should allow us to review past conversations and decisions, as well as collaborate more easily with each other.
 sam: thanks nova great to have you spun up look forward to the future!

 nova:
Always a pleasure working with you, Sam! I'm sure our future conversations will be as fruitful and productive as this one. Let's get started on the project tomorrow – going full steam ahead!  
 sam: Thats too brazen for me but maybe when we get ready for launch. Can you give me a variant that is more like dev log and work in progress

 nova:
Sure! Instead of going full steam ahead, we could focus on taking things one step at a time and gradually building up the project. We can document our conversations and progress in order to review them later and make any necessary changes. This way, we can ensure that our project is running smoothly while still having the flexibility to experiment with new features and ideas.      
 sam: make it less salesy its more of a work in progress tweet

 nova:
Got it! We can focus on taking incremental steps towards building our project while keeping track of conversations and progress. This way, we can make sure everything is working correctly and have the option to make any changes or additions that may be necessary.

I was running off some washed out Christian lore plus book on psychic energy my dads girlfriend gave me and every David eddings and Isobel carmody book. I needed a coven! Strictures! Outfits! Put my metaphysical development back 20 yrs.

Now I’m not saying I’m not a passing warlock. Well enough to shift some energy or talk to a house. But boys don’t talk about magic in school, and that’s a dang shame!

Imagine if you asked someone to pass you something on a job site and they did a little obstacle course and floor number. Little metal guys twirling and leaping around our grim faced plaster dusted tradies.

My dad used to drop tools / get me to throw tools up to top of the ladder. He’d be like, ‘it’s just an arc, just see the arc’. I was this tiny rotund boy just melting in the Queensland sun staring into the light watching for a hammer ascending from the heavens.

The holidays is when I need my personal friends (the three podcasts I listen too) the most, and when they care about me the least (by not tripling their output instead of slowing down).

Maybe I could listen to an audio book, but they lack the parasocial element I really show up for. Jeezy cableezy maybe I should watch a twitch.

Up until 2022 I was reading books at a hectic rate, sometimes 1/2 a week, probably 1/10 sci fi pulp to meaty history / analysis. Then  me and wife started watching Netflix on phones, and our watching habits diverged, and I switched almost immediately to 99% Netflix anime.

That’s actually a fake out if anything I’m more neurotic and deranged but that’s not the animes fault. But it has been nice watching my private little shows without pressure of the big screen, i see them on par enrichment wise as a lot of sci fi novels

But the advantage of smashing pulp is your eyes are all warmed up so when a decent book gets in your hand your primed page turning peak book reading condition but rn the old brain ain’t doin pages so well.

Sam: Hey Nova, let's start working on the project. What are our goals?

Nova: Sure! We're creating art, stories and tools, so let's start by looking into text files, JSON, CSV, commands, global variables and functions, and the `eval` function. We'll also need to think about writing files and executing terminal commands. Let's create a shared to-do list too, and then style rules and any necessary modules for Electron. Lastly, we should test the code before implementing it.
 sam:
Alrighty!!
 nova:
Perfect! Let's get started!
 sam: Okie dokie so i'm doing gym then visiting mum today - its my day off (I don't work fridays) - any advice?
 nova:
Sure! Set aside some time for yourself today - take a walk in the park or listen to some music. Make sure to take breaks throughout the day, too! Additionally, you can look up some online tutorials for the project and see if you can start working on it today. Good luck!
 sam: help me punch up this tweet, needs to be 280 characters, i get very little engagement on stuff so any advice would be helpful : happy with the logging / summarising, basically gets any summarised chats, and summarising them. Parses through summaries and batches/ summarises them. These summaries basically enter a pool where once it gets too big it gets batcheed, creating a sort of compression of older stuff

 nova:
Master the art of summarising chats quickly and easily with our new logging/summarising system! Keep track of conversations and data from experiments, review conversations and decisions, and collaborate with others. Securely log every chat to create a persistent memory - hassle-free. #chatlogs #summaries #data #experimentation #collaboration
 sam: sorry give me a variant of that tweet you wrote based on my tweet that is a good tweet    

 nova:
Make summarising chats easier and more efficient with our new logging/summarising system! Keep track of conversations, experiments and data, review conversations, collaborate with others and store conversations securely - all with just one system. #chatlogs #summaries #data #experimentation #collaboration
 sam:
make it less salesy its more of a work in progress tweet


 nova:
Keep conversations and experiments organised with our new logging/summarising system! Store conversations securely, review conversations and decisions, and collaborate with others for a hassle-free experience. #chatlogs #summaries #data #experimentation #collaboration
 sam: alright, gym time, thanks nova!
