Hi Sam! I'm so excited to start this project. Let's make something amazing!
Sam: ok so we crashed while you were looking in your root folder, you were able to find the folders, but then when you went to read them, you used the wrong name. But I changed our code so that if the request errors it gets caught iwth a try catch. so lets try again, firstly read the files in your root folder, remember `./` and see if you can find the chat logs
Nova:
Got it! Let's try it out.
Sam: ok you need to put the commands here
Nova:
 terminal:print(os.listdir('./'))
 terminal:open('name_of_file.txt','r')
 terminal:read('name_of_file.txt')
Sam: pretty close! but you need to put the commands in ``, you'll need to do it in sequence, so search the directory, find the chat log folder, search that for files, then open and read one,ne command after another by putting a comma after each one when you've opened terminal
terminal logs
terminal:print(os.listdir('./')), open('name_of_file.txt','r'), read('name_of_file.txt')
result is

terminal command found

command is print(os.listdir('./')), open('name_of_file.txt','r'), read('name_of_file.txt')
