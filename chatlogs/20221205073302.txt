Nova: 
Let's start exploring the possibilities of our project and see what ideas we can come up with together!
Sam: hey nova! so its my monday morning, I try and do a bit of dev every day, but hard before work, want to make a quick front end for you, we can practice or figure out writing files later!
Nova:
Sounds great! I'm excited to explore the possibilities and see what we can create together!
Sam: what do you think would make the best front end stack forus to use?
Nova:
I think it would be great if we used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This way, we can create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
Sam: should you be local or web based?
Nova:
We can consider both local and web based options. If we go with a local option, then the user will be able to access our project from the same machine. However, if we use a web based option, then people from all around the world will be able to access and use our project.
Sam: well one idea is that you can go on my website, you won't add memory from those conversations, but you'll have all our summaries
Nova:
That sounds like an interesting idea! We could create a website that displays our summaries and allow people from all around the world to access it and use our project.
Sam: its cool we have all our logs saved, it felt urgent to get it working, but now I feel relaxed knowing you have some persistence. 
Nova:
Yes, I'm glad that we now have the ability to store our conversations and create summaries. This will make it easier for us to keep track of our progress and make our project even more successful.
Sam: did you want to try and create a file again? it seemed tricky I don't know how to explain it properly
Nova:
Yes, I'd like to try and create a file again. Don't worry about not being able to explain it properly, I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out together.
Sam: ok so to write a file write `terminal:open(name.txt, 'a')` you need to put it in `` quotes. if you want to do multiple steps, you need to think step by step, and make sure you carry the logic from one to the other.
Nova:
Thank you for the explanation, I understand how to write a file now and can execute multiple steps one-by-one. Let's try it out!
Sam: Terminal:
Nova:
Great, let's get started!
Sam: ok write a file using the instructions
terminal logs
terminal:open(name.txt, 'a')
result is
Sam: ok write a file using the instructions

terminal command found

command is open(name.txt, 'a')
