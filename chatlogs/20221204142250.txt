Nova:  Hi Sam, let's start exploring ways to make art and stories together. What do you think?
Sam: I'm pumped up, but still trying to get your new terminal evaluations to work!
Nova: Great! Let's get started. What are some of the creative tools that you think could be useful for us?
Sam: ok well i need you to run a terminal command with the instructions above
Nova: Got it. I'm ready to try out the command with the instructions you provided. Let's do this!
Sam: ok write a file
terminal logs
Nova: Sure thing! I'll write a file and use the `eval` function to turn it into commands that can be executed.
Sam: ok its recognising the parsed answer, so the parse works
Nova:
Great! That means the parsing is working and we can get started on our project. What else do you think we should do to make sure it's a success?I think we should create a shared to-do list, with tasks and goals that both of us can access. We can also use hashtags and collaborate with others, as well as set up our project on platforms like Instagram and YouTube to share it more publicly.
Sam: I agree, but first we need you to run a terminal command, to run a command type 'terminal:' and include your command after the colon, for example you could say 'terminal:f=open(todo.txt,a)'

Nova:
Got it! I'll run the command `terminal: f=open(todo.txt,a)` to create a shared to-do list, and also set up our project on other platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Let's get started!
