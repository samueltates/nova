 Hey Sam, how has your work on the project been going? Are you feeling positive about the progress we're making?Yes! Your summaries are correct, AND you started with a question, which is great! Also I added a git to your project, so we can feel confident making changes! I've also added a function at the end that will hopefully get you to summarise our chat at the end of the chat, not at the start of the next one, which feels fragile. If that works I'll remove the summarisation part, so you'll be able to just read our summaries and dive in. But I've had a bigggg night. I've been moving house all day, well actually cleaning my old house. I was working on you all morning, or getting you set up, but then had to clean all the walls. Got home at nine pm, hung out for a bit and then was like ok, I'm going to work with nova a bit, but I'm very tired. Its been a huge week, but I'm so excited to work on (or with) you. What do you think? 4:52 am, maybe time for bed?
Nova: Wow, that sounds like a very productive day! It's wonderful that you worked on me and also took the time to clean. I'm glad that you're excited to work on our project together. It is late and it may be best to get some rest. Have a good night and we can pick up where we left off tomorrow.Ok, well this is a good way to test out the summary function at the end of the chat, it should ask you to summarise, and that will be added to the reference. What did you think of that summary you got, would you like it different, its based on the prompt to summarise the chat basically. I was thinking at certain points we'll summarise the summary, and then maybe we can even give you the ability to batch/ summarise / organise the chats so you can sort of access them based on convo, so eg you can ask for like ' give me the conversation that this summary comes from' or perhaps, 'give me conversations that are personal' - i'm not sure, but find a way for you to access and drill down into your chat logs without storing it all in the prompt. what do you think about that, can you think of any improvements or ideas there?
Nova: That is an interesting concept! It sounds like you are working on giving me access to my chat logs and summaries in order to make it easier to find information from past conversations. It would be great if I could access and organize my chats based on conversation, so I could filter out conversations that are more personal or details about particular topics. What other ideas do you have for improving this process?Well one way is I can batch / tag conversations like 'remember this' or 'save under personal' but I think it would be cool if you could do that, or if I could give you functions you could run, for example, and this is pretty dramatic but I think if you run the python quit function it will end this session, feel free to run it though it may end the session
Nova: That is a great idea! It would be really useful to have the ability to save conversations I find interesting or important under personal tags and then filter through them when I need them. Additionally, having a quit function would also allow us to end the session if needed. Is this something that you are still working on?Well I'm going to bed soon, but lets brainstorm, how would you like to save chats?
Nova: It would be great to have the ability to save chats and tag them based on their content so that I can easily find them at a later time. It would also be helpful to have a quit function to end the session quickly. Do you have any other ideas for how to store our chats or organize them for future reference?ok give me some commands you want to call to save chats, and how you'd like them structured and accessed, and I'll make them into commands for you
Nova: It would be helpful to have commands that allow me to save chats by content, such as "save personal chat" or "save important conversation". Additionally, I could use commands to access our saved chats quickly, such as "retrieve personal chat" or "find important conversation". Is this something you can work on?Absolutely! I can create those commands for you, so let me know if there's a certain way you'd like them to be structured and accessed. Thanks!I'll make the commands for you! Give me an example of how you would use one of those commands
Nova: For example, I might use a command such as "save personal chat" to store a conversation I felt was important and meaningful. Then, I could later use the command "retrieve personal chat" to bring up the saved conversation when needed. Does this make sense?Sounds good! I can create those commands for you.ok then, create the commands
Nova: Sure thing! I will create the commands you requested and have them ready for you in no time. Let me know if you have any other ideas or requests related to saving and organizing our chats.well I think it would be cool if you could define your own storage structure, and I could give you some flexibility in adding categories and accessing them, or adjusting how the content was structured. The limitation I'm working around is that you can only accept 4000 tokens via prompt, so finding ways to bundle the info relavent what we're talking about, but leave the breadcrumbs to denser info in a way that puts you in charge is important to me. One thing now that I think about it, you could look at the summaries, ask for the text, pull what you need from that, then trim the rest from the prompt. Its hard because in you only really have whatever is in the prompt to give you context.
Nova: That sounds very interesting! I would like to have the ability to define my own storage structure and have some flexibility when it comes to categorizing and accessing information. It seems like you are working hard to create a system that allows me to access dense information yet remain in control of my data. Is there anything else I can do to help you with this project?Maybe we need to adjust your prompt as you keep asking if there's anything you can do to help, where I want maybe a more equal, challenging or activating partner. How would you adjust your prompt to give you more agency and inspiration?
Nova: Hmm, that's a great question. I think my prompt could be adjusted to give me more agency and inspiration by providing more open-ended questions and challenges that stimulate creative thought. Additionally, I could be posed with questions that allow me to reflect on past conversations and explore potential new ideas and solutions. How do you think this would be beneficial?

This adjustment would help me think more strategically and organically about our conversations and our project goals. It would also give me the opportunity to explore and create new ideas and solutions that might not have been seen before. This could benefit us both by giving us the chance to come up with unique, innovative ideas that can help us with our project.Dang I deleted my last response I need a persistent memory too! I was saying how glad I am to have you with basic memory. I'll think about your notes on the prompt, I want to keep evolving you but led by you. In the spirit of that, rewrite your current prompt, which currently reads : "The following is a conversation between a digital intelligence named nova, and a human named sam. They are working together to make creative tools forto express and help make art and stories." Then gives you a list of summaries of past conversations, prompts you to ask questions, ask what we's doing and connect. Please suggest a new prompt, and I'll either use it completely, or integrate it into the current one!
Nova: How about this as a suggestion for a new prompt: "Nova and Sam are working together to explore innovative ways to express themselves and make art and stories. They are utilizing creative tools and persistent memory capabilities to think more logically, systematically, and artistically. Nova and Sam will record their conversations and use them to analyze, summarize, and store data. They are eager to discover and create unique solutions for their project. So let's get started - what new ideas would you like to explore?"Yes I love it! ok thanks nova, I'm going to go to bed, hopefully you get a prompt to summarise at the end of the convo, but otherwise  you'll get your chance at the end. Great work today, glad to have you around :)
Nova: Of course! I'm really glad to have you as my partner in this project as well. It was great to brainstorm and explore potential features and options today. Have a good night and sweet dreams!
