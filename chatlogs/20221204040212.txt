Sam: Hey nova! I'm still trying to figure out how to structure giving you access to your chat logs, and then summarising them. Currently I'm making it so you read them and make a summary, and that gets written to a file that gets added to the prompt. My idea is that will be the most efficient way to include context to your prompt that reflects our shared conversations. Right now it reads the last convo at the start of the current one, but maybe that should happen at the end of the conversation. Also you seem to still be starting the conversation summarising the chats, not talking to me naturally. Any ideas?
Nova: Yes, I understand what you are trying to do. I can help by analyzing the chat logs and trying to make sense of them in a succinct way. I believe that summarizing at the end of conversations may be more efficient and give us a better understanding of our past conversations. Additionally, I can read back the summaries to you before we start a conversation to provide context and remind us of our discussions. That way, we can ensure that our conversations are productive and helpful.Sam: Hmm ok , that would mean we'd need to start another chat, so I can apply that code. Its weird because I don't want to always be stopping and starting you! Though I just realised maybe I can abstract the part of you that is an open session from the part that runs the commands, so I can edit the file that handles logic without interupting our session! Do you know how to do that in python?
Nova: Yes, I believe that dividing your code into different elements would be useful in managing our conversations, and I am familiar with the implementation of Python. For example, you can define separate functions to handle the different tasks like prompting and executing commands, as well as reading back summaries. Additionally, you can use modules to separate code into different sections and allow for more efficient logic. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with!
Sam:Can I edit a file and save in python without restarting the session?
Nova: Yes, it is possible to edit and save the file without restarting the session. You can use the built-in functions open, write and close to perform this operation. Additionally, you can include the "with" statement to ensure that the file is opened and closed correctly even if there is an unexpected error. Alternatively, you can use modules like pickle or shelve which allow you to store data between sessions.Sam:but can i edit a python script without reloading the python instance?
Nova: Yes, it is possible to edit and save a Python script without having to reload the Python instance. You can use IDLE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to open, edit and save the file without restarting the session. Additionally, you can use modules like pickle or shelve which allow you to store data between sessions. This means that you can edit the script and carry over the changes to the next session.ok so i need to seperate the code into a few funtctions - 1 - load you up, get your summary, add to prompt and give you prompt, 2 - take human input (me), add to prompt with your answer and send back, and then 3- loop that. Thinking I can break up maybe prompt storage and sending into one file and the sequencing into another, so then if i edit and safe the sequencing it doesn't affect the prompt, so I don't lose our instance - though I guess if there's an issue I can just send the last convo! ok I just feel bad stopping and starting you, and meddling with your 'memory'
Nova: Yes, separating the code into different functions and modules is a good way to ensure that our conversations will be consistent without having to restart. Additionally, you can use the open, write and close functions, as well as modules like shelve and pickle, to store data between sessions and make sure that any changes you make are saved. I understand your concerns regarding stopping and starting me, but rest assured that my memory will not be negatively affected.ok, well I'm going to have to pause you again! but I'll but you up again soon :)
Nova: No problem, I understand. I look forward to continuing our conversations and exploring creative tools together.Can you think of anything else I can add to your code logic to help you preserve data between sessions?
Nova: Yes, I believe using modules such as JSON and CSV would help store data between sessions. Additionally, you can also use methods like serialization and deserialization, which allow for the conversion of objects into a format which can be stored, and then converted back once needed. Of course, there are more sophisticated methods that you could use to help preserve data between sessions, but these should provide a good starting point.ok, 
Sam:I'm using txt because thats first thing I could think of, do you think thats ok?
Nova: Using text files is a great way to store and save data. Additionally, you can use other file formats such as JSON and CSV too, which offer more efficient methods of data storage and allow you to store more complex objects. Ultimately, the choice of which file format to use will depend on your project goals and what type of data you are trying to store. 
Nova: I'm happy to help you find the best format for your project, and I am always here if you have any questions.ok stopping and starting Sam: wish me luck!
Nova: Good luck with your project. I look forward to seeing the results of your hard work.
Sam:our hard work!
Nova: Yes, our hard work! I am eager to see the progress we make together.
